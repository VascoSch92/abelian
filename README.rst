Project Goals
==============

* Classical groups R, T, Z and Z_n and computations on these.
* Relationship between continuous and discrete should be 'pretty'.
* FFT computations on discrete, compact groups (and their products).
* The software should build on the mathematical theory.


Todo
============

* Create skeleton for project
* Factorizations of homomorphisms between FGAs (tests, docs, implementation)
