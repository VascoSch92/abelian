A Python library for locally compact Abelian (LCA) groups.

.. note::

    This software is being built, and is not ready to be used yet.

Project Goals
==============

* Classical groups :math:`\mathbb{R}`, :math:`\mathbb{T}`, :math:`\mathbb{Z}` and :math:`\mathbb{Z}_n` and computations on these.
* Relationship between continuous and discrete should be 'pretty'.
* FFT computations on discrete, compact groups (and their products),
  e.g. :math:`\mathbb{Z}_{n_{1}} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{n_{2}} \oplus \dots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{n_{r}}`.
* The software should build on the mathematical theory.


Todo
============

* Create skeleton for project
* Factorizations of homomorphisms between FGAs (tests, docs, implementation)
